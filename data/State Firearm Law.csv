In evaluating whether such recent threats or acts of violence constitute probable cause to believe that such person poses a risk of imminent personal injury to himself or herself or to others, the judge may consider other factors including, but not limited to (A) the reckless use, display or brandishing of a firearm by such person, (B) a history of the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force by such person against other persons, (C) prior involuntary confinement of such person in a hospital for persons with psychiatric disabilities, and (D) the illegal use of controlled substances or abuse of alcohol by such person. If the judge is satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, such judge shall issue a warrant naming or describing the person, place or thing to be searched. The warrant shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer. It shall state the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and it shall command the officer to search within a reasonable time the person, place or thing named for any and all firearms.

However, both laws also include prohibitions about possessing a firearm while the order is in effect, essentially creating a senario where the subject of the order could not leagally purchase a firearm.

Code Ann. § 39-17-1315(b),"(b) (1)  In addition to the above individuals authorized to carry handguns by this or any other law of this state, a person wishing to carry a handgun shall apply to the sheriff of the county in which the person intends to carry a handgun for a handgun permit. The sheriff may issue such a permit and a written directive to persons not prohibited from purchasing firearms authorizing the person to carry a handgun, provided, that the person meets all the requirements of this section. A copy of the written directive shall be retained as a portion of the records of the particular sheriff who shall issue the directive.
(2) Prior to the issuance of the written directive and handgun permit, the sheriff shall conduct a background investigation of the person and shall issue the directive and permit only if satisfied with the results of the investigation, and may charge a reasonable fee for the investigation and other costs incurred under these provisions. The sheriff shall also require prior to the issuance of the directive and handgun permit, that the person successfully complete a suitable training period in the use of firearms in a state certified training program, which training shall include performance tests on a firing range, indicating the person to be qualified in the use of firearms; and the directive shall indicate that the person is properly qualified in the use of firearms and is knowledgeable as to safety precautions. Further, prior to issuing the directive and permit, the sheriff shall require the person to have in effect a liability policy in the amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) evidenced by a certificate of insurance made to the issuing sheriff. The insurance required must be for the specific purpose of carrying a firearm and must so state on the face of the policy. This requirement does not preclude insurance which by its nature provides coverage for this purpose as well as other general liability provisions. In lieu of liability insurance, the person may make a corporate surety bond in the amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for the above purpose, a copy of which must be provided to the sheriff by the bonding company. The sheriff shall charge to the person to whom the directive and permit is issued a fee in such amount as will pay the expenses involved in the training of the person in the use of firearms, if the training is conducted by or at the expense of the county. The sheriff may allow the training to be conducted by others, with the results being certified in writing to the satisfaction of the sheriff. The provisions herein relative to investigation and training and insurance/bond may be waived by the sheriff in those cases where the person is already authorized to carry firearms by the federal government or by the state government or a political subdivision thereof.
(3) The sheriff issuing the written directive authorizing a person to carry a handgun under this section may further require compliance with rules and regulations set by the sheriff regarding uniforms to be worn by the party carrying the handgun as a prerequisite to issuing the written directive and permit, and may revoke the written directive and permit at such time as the sheriff finds that any of the rules and regulations under this section have been violated, or for any other reason in the judgment of the sheriff which indicates the person's disqualification to carry a handgun, or to continue in the deputy's capacity as a deputy sheriff. In any event, the directive and permit issued shall expire one (1) year from the date of issue subject to reissue upon compliance of all prerequisites. In any county having a metropolitan form of government, the chief of police is the chief law enforcing officer and has the authority to issue permits to carry a handgun. Notwithstanding this provision, the sheriff of a metropolitan county shall issue a permit to carry a handgun only to paid employees of the sheriff's department who are charged with certain responsibilities and to no other persons.",10/1/1996,,,,,,,1
